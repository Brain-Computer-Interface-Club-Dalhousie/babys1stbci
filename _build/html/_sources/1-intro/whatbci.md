# What is a BCI?

A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology that allows people to control a computer with their mind. It does this by collecting signals from a person's brain and then identifying patterns within those signals and translating them into commands that the computer can understand. It's almost like having a direct connection between your brain and the computer.
